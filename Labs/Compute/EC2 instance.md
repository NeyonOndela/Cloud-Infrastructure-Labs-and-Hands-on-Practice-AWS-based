# AWS EC2 LAB 


## Overview

This lab provided practical experience with Amazon EC2, covering instance deployment, configuration, security, monitoring, and scaling. It also included deploying a web server and exploring automation and lifecycle management in a real-world cloud environment.

1. I began by logging into the AWS Management Console, then selected Instances from the left navigation pane and created an EC2 instance named **Web Server**. for **Amazon machine image(AMI)** i used **Amazon linux 2023 AMI** and i chose  t3.micro instance type, enabling protection to safeguard the instance from accidental removal. I also applied a **user Data script** to automatically install the **Apache web server** and set up a basic web page during launch.

## The instance was launched suceessfully

## Monitoring the instance

After the instance was up and running, I reviewed the available monitoring features. I verified both system and instance health using **Status Checks**, analyzed **CloudWatch metrics** to gain performance insights, and took an instance screenshot to simulate console-level access.

## The security group was updated to allow the required inbound traffic, and the web server was accessed successfully through a web browser.

## The instance was resized by modifying the instance type and adjusting the EBS volume to meet the required performance and storage needs.

**How did i accomplish this?** I stopped the EC2 instance and resized it from t3.micro to t3.small, which increased the available memory. I then modified the root EBS volume, expanding it from 8 GiB to 10 GiB, and restarted the instance. This task demonstrated how EC2 resources can be adjusted dynamically to meet changing workload requirements during operation.
