## Creating Networking Resources in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)


## Introduction

This lab was designed to provide practical experience in configuring a routable network inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The primary goal was to create and configure all the necessary networking components required to allow an EC2 instance to communicate with external networks. The lab was considered complete once successful connectivity outside the VPC was verified using the ping command.The exercise also aimed to improve familiarity with the AWS Management Console and strengthen understanding of cloud networking concepts.


## Scenario
Your role is a Cloud Support Engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS). During your shift, a customer from a startup company requests assistance regarding a networking issue within their AWS infrastructure. The email and an attachment of their architecture is below.

## Email from the customer
"Hello Cloud Support!
I previously reached out to you regarding help setting up my VPC. I thought I knew how to attach all the resources to make an internet connection, but I cannot even ping outside the VPC. All I need to do is ping! Can you please help me set up my VPC to where it has network connectivity and can ping? The architecture is below. Thanks!

Brock, startup owner"
